# Better Auth Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Better Auth with Prisma and anonymous authentication for the Picfluencer project.

## Changes Made

### Backend API (`/backend-api`)
1. Created `src/auth.ts` with:
   - Prisma adapter for PostgreSQL
   - Anonymous authentication plugin
   - Basic email/password authentication
   - Proper CORS configuration

2. Updated `src/index.ts` with:
   - Better Auth handler mounted at `/api/auth/*`
   - CORS middleware for mobile app compatibility
   - User session verification endpoint

3. Updated Prisma schema with Better Auth tables
4. Added environment variables in `.env`

### Mobile App (`/mobile`)
1. Created `lib/auth-client.ts` with:
   - Auth client configuration for mobile
   - Anonymous authentication plugin
   - Convenience methods for sign-in, sign-up, etc.

## Features Implemented
- Traditional email/password authentication
- Anonymous authentication for users who prefer not to provide PII
- Account linking functionality (anonymous to registered)
- Secure session management
- CORS support for mobile app integration

## Environment Variables Required
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - Secret key for encryption
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` - Base URL for the auth service

## Next Steps
1. Set up a PostgreSQL database server
2. Run the Prisma migrations when the database is available
3. Test authentication flows in both backend and mobile app
4. Implement UI components in the mobile app to interact with auth
