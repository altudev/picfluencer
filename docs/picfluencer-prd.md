## Problem

Micro and nano influencers (1K–100K followers) struggle to consistently produce, package, and distribute compelling content across multiple platforms while managing brand outreach and measuring what works. Their workflows are fragmented across many tools (notes, editing, caption generators, schedulers), which creates friction, context-switching, and inconsistent posting cadence—hurting growth and monetization.

* Customer: Micro and nano creators on YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram Reels, and X who seek predictable growth and brand deals without a team

* Customer problem:

  * Content pipeline friction: ideation → hooks → scripts → captions/hashtags → thumbnails → cross-platform formatting is time-consuming and inconsistent

  * Discovery gap: difficulty translating trends to their niche and audience voice

  * Packaging gap: optimizing titles, thumbnails, and platform-specific formats is tedious

  * Growth to monetization gap: unsure how to pitch brands, set rates, or build media kits

  * Measurement gap: no simple way to attribute what works and plan next content

* Evidence this is a problem:

  * Qualitative interviews and community feedback from creators indicate bottlenecks at ideation, packaging, and cross-platform repurposing; many report inconsistent posting due to complexity and burnout

  * Public creator economy reports (e.g., Influencer Marketing Hub, eMarketer) indicate the influencer marketing category continues to grow at a healthy pace, with brand budgets shifting to creators—yet value accrues disproportionately to creators who ship consistently and package well, underscoring the need for simpler tools for smaller creators

## Goals

* Output (v1): Achieve a 35% activation rate in week 1 (new sign-ups who export or publish at least one finished asset generated via the App Hub)

* Inputs (launch):

  * Onboarding completion rate ≥ 70% (new sign-ups who finish niche/voice setup)

  * Idea-to-script conversion ≥ 50% (sessions where a generated idea is turned into a script outline)

  * Export rate ≥ 40% (sessions resulting in an export to clipboard/file/scheduler)

* Non-goals (v1):

  * A full brand marketplace or payment processing

  * Native video editing/timeline features beyond text/script and thumbnails

  * Deep multi-language localization or enterprise team collaboration

## Requirements

High-level solution: A web-based AI App Hub that bundles a set of focused mini-apps for creators’ end-to-end short-form content workflow. The hub personalizes outputs to each creator’s niche and voice, enables quick repurposing across platforms, and includes lightweight growth/monetization helpers. v1 is optimized for speed-to-output and consistency rather than comprehensive feature depth.

Milestones

* Milestone 1 (Weeks 1–2): Core content creation loop with personalization, ideation, scripts, captions, and export

* Milestone 2 (Weeks 3–4): Packaging, repurposing, light scheduling, and basic growth/monetization helpers; harden reliability and instrumentation

Features by milestone and priority (P0 must-have, P1 nice-to-have)

Milestone 1: Core creation loop

* Onboarding and personalization (P0)

  * As a micro-influencer, I want to set my niche, audience, tone, and sample links so the hub produces on-brand ideas and scripts.

* Idea generator (P0)

  * As a creator, I want 10+ content ideas tailored to my niche and goals (growth, authority, conversion) so I can pick promising directions quickly.

* Hook and angle generator (P0)

  * As a creator, I want scroll-stopping hooks and angles per idea so I can test variants for higher retention.

* Script outline for short-form video (P0)

  * As a creator, I want a structured outline (hook → promise → proof → CTA) so I can record efficiently and stay on message.

* Caption and hashtag generator (P0)

  * As a creator, I want platform-specific captions and hashtags aligned with my voice so posting is quick and consistent.

* Titles and thumbnail prompts (P0)

  * As a creator, I want title options and thumbnail prompts (with overlay text suggestions) so I can increase CTR.

* Save, versioning, and library (P0)

  * As a creator, I want to save, iterate, and retrieve prior assets so I can reuse what works.

* Export to clipboard/files (P0)

  * As a creator, I want one-click export of scripts, captions, titles, and thumbnail prompts to clipboard, .txt, or Google Docs so I can post or hand off quickly.

* Feedback and rating loop (P0)

  * As a creator, I want to rate and comment on generated outputs so the system learns my preferences.

* Basic safety and guardrails (P0)

  * As a creator, I want outputs to avoid harmful or inappropriate content and provide disclaimers where needed.

Milestone 2: Packaging, repurposing, and growth helpers

* Cross-platform repurposing (P0)

  * As a creator, I want one-click reformatting of scripts/captions for TikTok, Reels, Shorts, and X so I can publish everywhere with minimal editing.

* Content calendar and reminders (P0)

  * As a creator, I want a simple calendar with cadence targets and reminder emails so I maintain consistency.

* Trend radar (P1)

  * As a creator, I want timely trend prompts (topics/sounds) mapped to my niche so I can ride relevant trends without losing brand fit.

* Brand pitch/DM generator (P1)

  * As a creator, I want personalized pitch emails/DMs with proof points so I can reach out to brands confidently.

* Rate card and mini media kit (P1)

  * As a creator, I want a simple, shareable rate card and media kit template so I can present myself professionally.

* Basic analytics and attribution (P1)

  * As a creator, I want to tag content with goals and log performance manually or via link so I can see what packaging drives results.

* UTM/link helper (P1)

  * As a creator, I want simple link templates with UTM suggestions so I can track conversions from posts.

* Templates gallery and community prompts (P1)

  * As a creator, I want curated templates (e.g., “educational explainer,” “product teardown”) and a community-shared prompt board so I can accelerate ideation.

System and platform requirements

* Authentication: email + magic link (P0)

* Creator profile store: niche, voice, prohibited topics, example links (P0)

* LLM provider integration with prompt versioning and safe output filters (P0)

* Telemetry: event tracking for onboarding, idea generation, script creation, export, ratings (P0)

* Performance: sub-3s response for most generations; background jobs for longer tasks (P0)

* Accessibility: keyboard navigation, readable contrast, clear error states (P0)

* Data privacy: explicit content retention and deletion controls; no training on private data without opt-in (P0)

* Integrations: Google Drive export (P1); social platform posting integrations are out-of-scope for v1

Open questions

* What guardrail thresholds and categories do we enforce beyond platform policies (e.g., medical claims, financial advice)?

* Do we cache creator-specific embeddings for faster personalization in v1, or defer to v2?

* Should we include a lightweight thumbnail generator (image) in v1, or keep it to structured prompts only?

* Which LLM(s) to use for cost/quality balance and multilingual support?

* Will we enable limited trend data ingestion in v1 (RSS, public APIs), or rely on manual inputs?

## Launch plan

Rollout approach

* Staged rollout over 4 weeks with a private beta cohort of 100–200 creators from community/YouTube audience; invite codes to control scale

* Instrumentation-first: all P0 funnels and a lightweight quality rating system live at day 1 of beta

* Experiment: App Hub vs. baseline Notion templates for onboarding creators to measure activation lift

  * Success criteria: +20% absolute lift in activation rate (export ≥ 1 asset in week 1)

  * Eligibility: New sign-ups during beta on web

  * Test: Full App Hub experience (P0 features)

  * Control: Access to a static Notion “creator toolkit” with similar prompts/templates

  * Ramp: Start 20% test / 80% control (day 2), move to 50/50 (day 7), 100% after meeting success and reliability thresholds

Timeline (4 weeks)

* Week 1

  * Build: Onboarding, profile store, idea + hook generator, basic export, analytics events

  * Design: Core flows and system prompts library; initial UI polish

  * GTM: Recruit beta cohort, set up feedback channels (Discord, DMs, email)

* Week 2

  * Build: Script outline, captions/hashtags, titles/thumbnail prompts, save/library, feedback ratings

  * QA: Guardrails and safe output checks; latency improvements

  * GTM: Publish teaser video; open waitlist

* Week 3

  * Build: Cross-platform repurposing, content calendar/reminders, performance hardening

  * Analytics: Dashboards for activation, conversion, export, and ratings

  * Beta: Invite first 100 creators; start experiment at 20/80

* Week 4

  * Build: P1 quick wins (brand pitch generator or templates gallery), bug fixes

  * Experiment: Ramp to 50/50; evaluate success criteria

  * Launch: Public beta announcement if reliability/metrics met; else extend private beta 1–2 weeks

Feedback and iteration loop

* Channels: Private DMs (Twitter/Instagram), Discord community, YouTube comments on launch/update videos, in-app feedback widget

* Triage:

  * Daily: Review top 10 friction points (drop-offs, confusion), prioritize P0 fixes

  * Weekly: Release notes and roadmap updates shared with community; creator office hours

* Iteration cadence:

  * Hotfixes within 24 hours for blockers; weekly feature drops; biweekly prompt tuning and UX tweaks

  * Metrics gates: Do not expand invites until activation ≥ target and reliability SLOs are met

Post-launch next steps

* Scale cohort and add trend radar + brand outreach helpers

* Evaluate social API integrations for scheduling/posting if demand is strong

* Deepen analytics (import via platform links, simple attribution) and expand templates library for niche verticals
